    <div class="article-content">
      <p>If you're encountering problems with the accuracy of your location and suspect it's related to your GPS, follow the steps below to resolve the issue.</p>

<h4><strong>Check device compatibility</strong></h4>
<p>The accuracy of GPS largely depends on the device you're using. Make sure you're using a supported device by referring to our list of compatible devices.</p>

<h4><strong>Ensure a strong signal strength</strong></h4>
<p>Having a robust internet connection is essential for GPS accuracy. Whether you're connected via cellular data or Wi-Fi, ensure you have a strong signal. However, keep in mind that a full Wi-Fi signal or maximum bars of cellular data may not always guarantee a stable connection. During peak usage periods or while traveling in a moving vehicle, both connections can slow down or become unstable. If possible, try switching between Wi-Fi and cellular data to see if it improves GPS accuracy.</p>

<h4><strong>Consider urban areas</strong></h4>
<p>When playing in urban areas with numerous tall buildings, be aware that your GPS signal may drift or jump due to signal interference.</p>

<h4><strong>Enable "Improve Location Accuracy" (Android users only)</strong></h4>
<p>For Android users, there is an option to enable the "Improve Location Accuracy" setting. This feature allows your device to utilize additional information, such as data from internal sensors, to enhance location determination.</p>

<p>By following these troubleshooting steps, you can address location accuracy issues related to your GPS.</p>
