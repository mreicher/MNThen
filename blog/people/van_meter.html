          <article>

          <p class="lead">Depression-era gangster Homer Van Meter always knew his life of crime would likely end in either incarceration or death. On August 23, 1934, one month and one day after the shooting death of John Dillinger outside of Chicago's Biograph Theater, Van Meter met his violent demise during a gunfight with Saint Paul police near the intersection of University Ave. and Marion St. He was twenty-eight years old.</p>

            <p>Van Meter, a former Lieutenant in Dillinger's gang, arrived at the Saint Paul Auto Company car dealership on University Ave. around 4:30 PM, planning to buy a car and flee the area ahead of the ever-encroaching authorities. He encountered four armed police officers leaving the dealership at around 5 PM, including Chief Frank Cullen, Detective Tom Brown, and two other detectives.</p>

            <p>Discrepancies in eyewitness accounts have fueled debate over what happened next. While the outcome of Van Meter's story is clear, the moments leading up to his death have been called into question. </p>

            <p>Detective Brown, Chief Cullen, and the detectives hopped in a car at around 5 PM, armed with two machine guns and two shotguns, to arrest Van Meter, who they had "a line on" for at least the previous two weeks. The group intended to take Van Meter alive. According to Brown, officers opened fire on Van Meter only after he fired at them first.</p>

            <p>The group waited near the intersection of University Ave. and Marion St. until Van Meter walked by. When the gangster reached the corner, Brown and Cullen jumped out and ordered Van Meter to stop. The gangster immediately reached for his pistol, turned, and fired at the two men – narrowly missing Brown with both shots. </p>         

            <p>Van Meter ran across University and south on Marion while the officers returned fire, briefly halting when an older woman entered the line of fire. After ensuring her safety, the police resumed shooting.</p>         

            <p>Two officers, likely Cullen and Brown, chased the outlaw into a dead-end alley and fired their guns at him. Van Meter dropped to the ground. By the time they reached him, the gangster was dead. His pistol was still in his hand.</p>   

            <p>Mrs. Andrew Stedje, an eyewitness to the incident from the southeast corner of University and Marion, told a different story. Shortly after hearing two shots, she saw Van Meter run by, sprinting down Marion toward the alley. Brown and Cullen chased him. Van Meter had a straw hat in his hand. Mrs. Stedje, realizing her children were playing nearby, followed the chase.</p>         

            <p>The two officers immediately started shooting when they reached the alley. A bullet-riddled Van Meter soon crumpled to the ground, and the hat he had held rolled away. The men fired several more shots at his prone body. Newspapers later reported Van Meter had as many as fifty bullet wounds from the gunfight.</p>

          <p>Officers picked the straw hat up off the ground and placed it over the dead man's face. They reportedly found just over $1400 on the body.</p>
            <p>Those who knew Van Meter questioned the official statement concerning money taken from him after his death. They figured he had more than $9,000 with him that day — some reporting as much as $18,000. Not the $1400 the police recovered. He was leaving town and needed as much money as possible to start his new life.</p>

            <p>In the days after the shooting, multiple witnesses stated Van Meter never pointed a gun at anyone. They reported the gangster held his hat in one hand and that the other one may have been empty. The only guns they reported seeing were those held by the police.</p>

            <p>Van Meter had been set up. But by who? The official report was that either an employee at the dealership or relatives of a love interest had contacted local authorities. However, the outlaw was caught in a coordinated effort between police and area criminals to see his death. The bombastic and impulsive Van Meter had waited too long to disappear, and the underworld had grown tired of him. </p>

            <p>Hollyhocks Casino owner Jack Pfeifer, acting in concert with gangsters Tommny Gannon and Harry Sawyer, contacted Detective Tom Brown, his friend with the Saint Paul Police, the morning of the 23rd after meeting with Van Meter. Pfeifer may have been holding on to some of Van Meter's money and didn't want to return it.</p>

            <p>In the subsequent weeks, Brown embarked on a hero's tour, recounting his version of events to receptive journalists—a revitalization of the tarnished former Police Chief's reputation that briefly restored his standing within the local law enforcement circle. Brown's entanglement in corruption probes linked to kidnapping schemes with the Barker-Karpis gang, who had recently left Saint Paul, suggested a potential motive for silencing Van Meter. </p>

            <p>He wanted to bury the evidence of their shared misdeeds.</p>

            <p>Despite his best efforts, Brown's crimes eventually caught up to him. He was fired for the part authorities believed he played in the later kidnappings of William Hamm Jr. and Edward Bremer. They couldn't prove his involvement, so the former lawman never was arrested — but his days with local law enforcement were officially over.</p>

            <p>When Van Meter's body was returned to his family, they were disgusted by the extreme police response, believing officers had used the gangster's body for target practice. After a private funeral, he was buried at Lindenwood Cemetery in Fort Wayne, Indiana. </p>

            <p>Van Meter's death sent a message to the underworld and overworld that the tide was turning. The gangster era would soon be over. However, discrepancies between witness testimonies and the official narrative that day left questions. Was Van Meter killed in self-defense or executed by a crooked cop? Whatever the circumstances were, the gangster met his violent end on August 23, 1934, in St. Paul. </p>
