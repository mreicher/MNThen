          <article>


          <p class="lead">Commercial State Bank President Edward Bremer's high profile and structured timeliness were two keys to his success. The heir to the Schmidt Brewery fortune was a man to whom you could set your watch. Those assets benefited him immensely, both personally and financially.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, they were likely the reason behind the worst three weeks of his life.</p>

            <p>The December 1933 ratification of the 21st Amendment dried up the illegal alcohol trade, ending an income source for the criminal underworld that needed to be replaced. Hoping to make large amounts of money quickly without the risks associated with robbing banks, the Barker-Karpis Gang turned to high-profile kidnapping. They'd been mostly successful months prior with the abduction of William Hamm Jr.</p>

            <p>They felt Bremer was the perfect target for trying again.</p>

            <p>However, there was a fair share of concern among gang members during the planning process. Alvin Karpis, one of the gang's leaders, told Harry Sawyer, the man who organized the kidnapping, that he would rather rob a bank than take Bremer. Karpis was concerned about the possibility of significant public backlash. Ultimately, the chance for a big payday was too great to pass up.</p>         

            <p>On a frigid January 17, 1934, morning at around 8:25 AM, Bremer went to work after dropping his daughter Betty off at the Summit School at 1150 Goodrich Avenue. He was ambushed and abducted only blocks away on the corner of Lexington and Goodrich. Later identified as the Barker-Karpis Gang, his kidnappers had followed him briefly to learn his morning routine.</p>         

            <p>Once the gang had taken Bremer, they called his trusted business associate and former chauffeur Walter Magee to demand a ransom. The message was simple; they had "snatched" Bremer and wanted two hundred thousand dollars for his safe return. Someone associated with the gang left a ransom note with similar demands in the back office of Magee's house. The written message had instructions leading to Bremer's abandoned car.</p>   

            <p>Just like the Hamm Jr. kidnapping the previous June, there were requirements for how the family was to pay the ransom: no new or consecutive money and various issues. Magee was then to place the money in two suit box cartons large enough to hold every bill. The note closed by reassuring that if the family did their part to see Bremer's return, the gang would release him.</p>         

            <p>When the Bremer family was ready to make the ransom payment, the kidnappers told them to place an ad in the "personals" section of the Minneapolis Tribune. It needed to say, "We Are Ready, Alice." FBI field agents were concerned with local police's overzealous nature. The agents wanted to learn the pay-off person's identity and have him lead them back to the other kidnappers. Local law enforcement planned to kill them.</p>

          <p>Bremer's father was friends with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and having his son's abduction only months after Hamm Jr.'s kidnapping in the same city was too much to bear. The president, politicians, newspapers throughout the country, and other prominent citizens all looked to FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover for answers. They pressured the bureau to solve this case quickly. </p>

            <p>Despite the gang's insistence the police not get involved, everyone wanted to help. Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson called the Bremer family to offer the support of every law enforcement agency in the state. Gang member Fred Barker suggested they kill Bremer in retaliation but was overruled.</p>

            <p>After twenty-two uncomfortable days and one misguided attempt to renegotiate the amount with their son's captors, the Bremer family paid the ransom — against J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI's wishes.</p>

            <p>Adolph Bremer, Edward's father, wrote a note delivered with the money, "To the parties holding Edward: I've done my part and kept my word 100 percent just as I said I would. This money is not marked and is the full amount asked for. And now, boys, I am counting on your honor. Be sports and do the square thing by turning Edward loose at once. (Signed) Adolf Bremer."</p>

            <p>The kidnappers did the "square thing." Bremer was dropped off between Rochester and Chatfield along Highway 52 around 8 PM on February 7, 1934. The gang told him to take a bus back to Saint Paul. Bremer didn't have much information to give the FBI upon returning home. He told them he was in a sedan with three men and had spent a lot of time blindfolded in the car. The gang warned Bremer that they would kill his daughter if he talked. The banker wasn't willing to offer much about his captors.</p>

<p>While the ransom was paid, things didn't end well for the gangsters. Now that Bremer was home, everyone was ready to take the fight to the country's gangster problem.</p>

<p>Despite previous warnings, Bremer was a big help to the FBI. He tried to remember every detail he could, including the wallpaper used in the house he was held in, allowing authorities to tie the gang to the crime. Many felt Bremer's change of heart was due to the bureau's belief his family's alleged criminal behavior led to his kidnapping. If he didn't cooperate, the FBI threatened to go public with the information they had.</p>

<p>The national focus of the abduction, and the fact that it happened less than a year after Hamm's kidnapping, gave the FBI the power it needed to end the threat. This would be the last crime of the Barker-Karpis Gang. Within two years of the Bremer kidnapping, the FBI had essentially ended the era of the 'Public Enemy.'</p>

<p>Gang member Karpis, for his part, was not a fan of their prisoner. Retelling the story after his arrest for participating in the kidnapping, he noted that Bremer wasn't the best person to spend a kidnapping with, describing him as a "demanding, cranky prisoner who informed the gang not to expect much of a ransom."</p>
