        <!-- Lead Paragraph -->
        <div class="lead mb-5">
          <p>Locals were shocked by the death of prominent St. Paul butcher Louis Arbogast, a man who, along with his family, had lived a quiet life in a large home near the city’s downtown. But in the early morning of May 13, 1909, everything changed, and the patriarch's sudden passing, while he lay asleep in his bed in the second-floor bedroom, ultimately left authorities and the community with far more questions than answers.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Blog Content -->
        <div class="blog-content">
          <p>Arbogast's daughter Ida noticed smoke billowing from the second floor and discovered her father unconscious, his mattress ablaze.  The scene was gruesome: he had been repeatedly struck in the back of the head with a heavy, blunt object, his kerosene-soaked bed set on fire while he lay covered in blood and feathers. Despite help from a sixteen-year-old newspaper boy and neighbors, Mr. Arbogast died on the way to the hospital, his death occurring well after firefighters pulled him from the flames.</p>

          <p>In the basement, police discovered a blood-stained four-pound ax. The locked windows and doors suggested an inside job, but despite questioning everyone in the house, authorities found it impossible to get information about the crime. The family's unwillingness to cooperate baffled investigators. Despite the obstacles, they soon focused their attention on Arbogast’s wife Minnie and daughter Louise. Both were charged with first-degree murder, and if either was convicted, would likely face death by hanging.</p>

          <p>Because the murder was so brutal, authorities suspected someone mentally unstable had committed the crime, and their investigation quickly focused on Louise.  Her mental health had been a topic of concern for years, even though her father clearly favored her.  She had a long-time fascination with fortune-tellers and clairvoyants, and believed a mysterious man was pursuing her and her sister, Ida, intending to harm them.  Louise had spent the previous winter away because of her condition and only recently returned home.</p>

          <p>When authorities brought Minnie and Louise together, the mother, who had initially defended her daughter, immediately turned on her. Claiming to have been in the bathroom during the attack, Mrs. Arbogast stated that she saw Louise leaving the bedroom.  She then accused Louise of the murder, insisting on her own innocence.</p>

          <p>Four days before her Louis Arbogast was killed, and despite warnings from doctors not to bring her home too early, Louise had returned from an extended stay at an Eau Claire sanitarium. Her mother told authorities Louise had attacked her with a hammer the night before the murder occurred. Upon further investigation, police concluded Louise had developed some kind of 'demonic frenzy' because of her interests. As a result, she went temporarily insane and murdered her father.</p>

          <p>Mrs. Arbogast wasn't exactly in the clear. At first, she stated she was in the bathroom for five minutes while the crime was being committed. She later claimed to be in the bathtub. A neighbor testified Minnie told her she was making breakfast when the murder took place, not in the bathroom, as she’d previously reported. Ida said she had pulled her mother from the flaming bed, but never mentioned the bathroom. The ever-changing stories Mrs. Arbogast told weren't necessarily incriminating, but certainly not exonerating either.</p>

          <p>Rumors also swirled around the relationship between Louis and Louise.  Newspaper reports claimed he had recently told his wife he was leaving the family to go to Alaska with Louise and her fiancé.  Whispers of a secret sexual relationship between father and daughter soon followed.  If true, this could have driven Mrs. Arbogast to murder.  The police had to consider it a potential motive.</p>

          <p>Mother and daughter both pleaded not guilty, and the trial was set for the fall of 1909. The first case to go to trial was Mrs. Arbogast's. After two weeks of evidence and witness testimony by the prosecution and defense, a jury of twelve men ruled she was not guilty of first-degree murder. A lighter sentence was proposed to the judge by the jury - possibly justifiable homicide; however, he refused, saying that the first-degree murder finding was all-or-nothing.</p>

          <p>A little more than a week after Minnie’s acquittal, the prosecution dropped the case against her daughter. The Ramsey County Attorney felt the evidence against her, similar to that used against her mother, wasn't enough to secure a conviction.</p>

          <p>The case was eventually relegated to history books, unsolved.</p>
