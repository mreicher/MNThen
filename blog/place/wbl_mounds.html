          <article>

          <p class="lead">The White Bear Lake area has a captivating history spanning centuries, likely beginning around 1400-1700 A.D. During this time, the Woodland Indians, ancestors of the Dakota, thrived in this region. They utilized the land for hunting and gathering, and notably, they constructed earthen mounds near present-day Lake Avenue and Shady Lane to honor their departed loved ones. These burial mounds were enduring symbols of ancient traditions and spiritual beliefs. </p>

            <p>However, as Euro-American colonists arrived and settled in the area in the nineteenth century, preserving these sacred burial mounds became a subject of intense debate. The clash between Native American heritage and encroaching modern development fueled the contentious discussions. With the arrival of settlers came the construction of roads, including one that passed close to area burial mounds. </p>

            <p>Among the nine mounds that once adorned the landscape near the northwest section of White Bear Lake, the largest and most prominent was situated near the intersection of Lake Avenue and Shady Lane. This mound commanded attention, towering at approximately 20 feet and spanning a width of 20 to 80 feet. Its significance attracted numerous visitors, establishing it as a noteworthy tourist attraction.  </p>

            <p>In 1885, during his vacation time, William Markoe, son of the property owner where the mound stood, dedicated himself to constructing a gazebo atop the mound. With meticulous care, he crafted a one-of-a-kind structure using 480 pieces of tamarack, each measuring 15 inches. The gazebo featured a round table and circular chairs, offering visitors an idyllic perch to admire the area's breathtaking surroundings. Sadly, it was destroyed when a severe storm ravaged the area in 1887. </p>

            <p>The controversy surrounding the burial mounds took a dramatic turn following a tragic incident involving Charles Wheeler, his sister Ellen "Nellie" Wheeler, and Delia Delano. These three individuals, from the Stillwater area, experienced a devastating accident while driving their carriage near the lake. In a heart-wrenching moment, their horses were startled, causing the carriage to overturn. Unfortunately, Charles, only 24 years old, lost his life after being thrown from the carriage and colliding with a tree. </p>         

            <p>This incident stirred intense emotions, with some speculatively attributing the horses' fright to the presence of "spirits" emanating from the sacred burial mounds. The incident further fueled an already heated controversy about their continued existence.  </p>

            <p>Seeking justice, Nellie Wheeler took legal action by filing a lawsuit against the Village of White Bear to hold them financially accountable for her injuries. Although her claim was ultimately denied, the incident played a pivotal role in shaping the debate's outcome. As a result of her case, the road was ordered to be straightened out, reflecting the incident's impact on the landscape and transportation infrastructure. Sadly, recent evidence has shown the carriage was likely nowhere near the burial mounds when the fatal accident occurred.  </p>

            <p>Regardless of that fact, the focal point of the debate revolved around the largest mound near Shady Lane. Due to the curved path around it, which posed a potential hazard for passing carriages, efforts to remove the mound gained traction. However, the controversy persisted for several years, with proponents advocating for preserving the sacred grounds. Historical society photos and newspaper clippings from that era depict the burial mounds as a popular tourist attraction, captivating visitors and drawing them to White Bear Lake.  </p>

            <p>In 1889, the burial mounds underwent excavation, and the remains of seventeen Native Americans were reburied in an unmarked mass grave at Union Cemetery. The mass grave served as the final resting place for the excavated remains, although uncertainty lingers today over the fate of two unaccounted-for natives. A century later, a marker was placed at the grave site during the centennial remembrance of the mound's demolition.  </p>

              <p>The loss of the burial mounds were deeply felt, and dedicated efforts have been made to ensure their memory endures. The marker along the Lake Avenue path at Shady Lane stands as a poignant reminder of the mounds' former presence and the intriguing history they held. It commemorates the area's historical significance and attempts to clarify the controversy that changed the area's landscape near the lake.  </p>
