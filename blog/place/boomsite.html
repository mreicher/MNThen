        <!-- Lead Paragraph -->
        <div class="lead mb-5">
          <p>On June 12, 1914, shortly after 2:30 PM, the final log passed through the St. Croix Boom Site sorting works, marking the end of nearly six decades of operation on the St. Croix River. Seventy-nine-year-old William Franklin 'Frank' McGray, the Boom Company’s former superintendent and a fifty-year employee who hitched the first log through the boom in 1856, was present to hitch the last. The collapse of the boom contributed to the decline of Stillwater, located a short distance downriver, as a regional lumbering center.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Blog Content -->
        <div class="blog-content">
          <p>At its peak, logs covered over nine miles of river upstream. From 1880 to 1910 Minnesota trailed only Wisconsin and Michigan in lumber production. However, by the time the Boom closed, the once-lush riverbanks stood bare. Hills, pens, and all other traces of the lumber industry disappeared. The final logs that passed through the boom in 1914, the last of an estimated 15 billion board feet of logs since the company’s inception, were part of the previous season’s drive.</p>

          <p>The St. Croix Boom Company was first organized in 1851 with a capital stock of $10,000. The initial boom was constructed near an island across from Osceola, Wisconsin. Logs floated downriver from logging camps were gathered, sorted, measured, and grouped together to be distributed. As lumber production increased, this channel proved too narrow to handle the volume of logs, leading the company, under new owners, to obtain a new charter in 1856. With capital stock increased to $100,000, they built a new boom a couple miles north of Stillwater.</p>

          <p>The process remained largely the same. Each logging camp marked its logs with a unique symbol, registered with the surveyor general to establish ownership. These marks, typically stamped into the bark or carved into the wood, identified which camp had felled each log. Once marked, the logs were released into the river to float downstream toward the boom.</p>

          <p>At the boom, a series of barriers called a 'catch boom' stopped the log drive for sorting. Workers known as catch markers examined and verified each log's original camp mark—of which there were over 2,000 registered from as many as 50 to 60 logging camps operating simultaneously along the river—and re-marked them. After verification, logs were guided through a 'sorting gap' and directed into holding pens, where they were assigned a unique identifier number, measured for volume in board feet, and organized for transport to the owner’s respective sawmills.</p>         

          <p>An 1886 log jam upriver near Taylor’s Falls negatively impacted business at the boom. The logs were caught at Angle Rock, a 90 degree turn in the river. An estimated 125 to 150 million board feet became stuck leading to a log jam more than two miles long. Two steamboats, along with land-based steam engines and horses were used to pull out logs from the jam with ropes. Only a small percentage of the logs were freed this way. On July 2, a 24-pound dynamite charge broke loose 1 million feet and dislodged 15 million more, splitting the jam. Clean-up continued into September. In 1890 the Nevers Dam was constructed to help control the flow of both logs and water.</p>         

          <p>Despite the challenges, the volume was staggering. There were logs cut on the St. Croix as early as the 1837 - 1838 season. 300,000 feet of logs were cut that year, a number that grew to 110 million by the 1852 - 1853 season. The high-water mark of 492 million came in 1890, but years of rampant overexploitation soon impacted the industry, and after cutting 271 million feet in 1904, the area’s output fell to 121 million only a year later. Gradual decreases continued until it was no longer profitable for the boom company to remain in business.</p>   

          <p>The St. Croix Boom was highly profitable, aided by the state's generous charter fees and the boom's adaptable design that could open and close sections as the in-flow of logs dictated. However, industrialization and shifting attitudes towards the river ultimately led to its downfall. The once-lush valley had been largely deforested, with trains largely replacing river transport. As steamboats became more valued to nearby towns, the logs that had once impeded their traffic were cleared from the waterway. Soon after the final log was hitched through the boom, the site was completely removed from the river.</p>         

          <p>Today, the site is a waypoint along Highway 95, recognized by the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 for its contributions to the region.</p>
