        <div class="lead mb-5">
          <p>The March 23, 1912, murder of Alice Matthews shocked Minneapolis. Attacked by a dark, brooding figure only a few doors from her home, she did everything possible to save herself. Matthews fought bravely, but her cries for help went unheeded. The case dominated local papers for weeks, but eventually became old news. Her attacker was never found.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Blog Content -->
        <div class="blog-content">
          <p>Hard-working and likable, the twenty-year-old Matthews was a flour packer at the Pillsbury Mill. She lived at 3547 S. 20th Ave in south Minneapolis with her father, stepmother, half-brother, and two younger sisters.</p>

          <p>Matthews and her younger sister Jennie often went out on the weekend but always shared plans with their father. He was a worrier and wanted to know they’d be safe. That weekend, Matthews told him she would meet up with Ida Belfy and Minnie Morgan for a show at the Isis Theatre and then have dinner.</p>

          <p>She intended to spend the night at Ms. Belfy’s to avoid riding the streetcar alone at night, but her plans changed during the show. Instead, after dinner, she boarded the southbound Cedar streetcar for home.</p>

          <p>It was 11:06 PM.</p>

          <p>The streetcar stopped at Cedar and 34th Street, and Matthews walked the rest of the way. Less than a half block from home, an unknown assailant attacked her. She screamed, but her cries went unanswered. Matthews fought bravely but was strangled and left to die alone. Her clothes were tattered, her neck scratched and bruised, and her lips swollen.</p>

          <p>Neighbors reported hearing cries of “please let me go” between 11:30 and 11:45 PM. Mrs. H.C. Thomas, who lived two doors from the Matthews family, was awakened by the yells but saw nothing and assumed it was kids playing. Mrs. J. Larsen and her son Verner, who lived down the block, stepped onto their porch to investigate but couldn’t see anything in the dark. Larsen sent Verner next door to the Tibbetts' to call the police.</p>

          <p>Alerted by Verner, Mrs. G.W. Tibbetts and her daughter Eva rushed outside to investigate. About a hundred feet from the unknown body, it moved, and they ran back inside to call the Sixth Precinct. A dispatcher promised to send an officer. Tibbetts later reported a motorcycle patrolman arrived “after a time” at 35th Street and 20th Ave, about half a block from the scene. Since he wasn’t in uniform, they were afraid to flag him down. After standing around for a while, the officer rode away.</p>

          <p>They continued to hear faint movements from the person on the ground. At 12:30 AM, Mrs. Tibbetts called the police again, suggesting it was probably a drunk and they should come get him. She gave her address and promised to leave a light on. The dispatcher said they’d send someone on horseback, but after waiting over an hour, Mrs. Tibbetts and her daughter put the light out and went to bed.</p>

          <p>Eva Tibbetts discovered the lifeless body of Alice Matthews at around 7:00 AM. She immediately grabbed her mother to notify the Matthews family. Jennie Matthews later reported brushing against the body around 1:00 AM. Assuming it was a passed-out drunk, she ran home without saying anything.</p>

          <p>Mrs. Tibbets called the police again. This time, they had no issues finding the crime scene. They discovered a hatpin near Matthews' body, likely used to try to ward off her attacker. The police canvassed the neighborhood looking for a man with scratches on his hands and face. They also talked to streetcar conductors and anyone else who rode when Matthews did.</p>

          <p>Newspapers called the crime the most brutal in city history. The mayor criticized the police response, increasing pressure to find the killer. Authorities were inundated with reports of suspicious men, but none proved useful, and the police found no solid leads. To aid the investigation, the governor, mayor, and City Council each offered a $500 reward for information leading to the capture of the murderer.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, the killer was never found. The police arrested numerous suspects, but none were linked to the crime. One man confessed four times over three years but was deemed to have monomania, an unhealthy obsession with the case, and was committed to an asylum in Rochester, MN.</p>

          <p>On March 27, 1912, Matthews was buried at Layman’s Cemetery in Minneapolis, with over a thousand attendees. Police scanned the crowd for suspicious behavior but found no leads.</p>

          <p>Matthews’ murder and the search for her killer remained headline news until April 15, 1912, when the RMS Titanic sank and overshadowed the case. Although local citizens continued to discuss Matthews and seek justice, the investigation eventually went cold.</p>
