        <!-- Lead Paragraph -->
        <div class="lead mb-5">
          <p>An explosion in the popularity of bicycling followed the introduction of the "safety" bicycle in the mid-1880s. Traveling as far as your wheels would take you was exciting, and soon, a large portion of the population was riding a bicycle. There were also social benefits. Bikes played a crucial role in the push for better public roads during this time and were a driving force behind the women's emancipation movement of the era.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Blog Content -->
        <div class="blog-content">
          <p>In taking to the "wheel," women reshaped how society viewed them. Bicycling, once a males-only recreation, now had universal appeal. The bicycle helped usher in the "new woman" and gave her access to a world that offered the independence she formerly lacked. Ladies' professional six-day bicycle races embodied many of those virtues.</p>

          <p>Races took place on circular wooden tracks nationwide from 1888 to 1902. Contestants competed over six consecutive days for a predetermined time of two and twelve hours per day. Prize money was distributed between the competitors, with most of the winnings given to the race's champion.</p>

          <p>One of the circuit's big names was Minneapolis resident Leona Marie "Dottie" Farnsworth, born around 1873 to Austin Farnsworth and Sarah Bartholomew. After graduating in July 1895 from St. Paul's St. Joseph's Academy, Dottie took up bicycling. She competed in her first professional six-day race in December. When Dottie triumphantly crossed the finish line, she had ridden well over 300 miles. That feat shattered the previous world record for eighteen hours of racing.</p>

          <p>Dottie was brash and supremely confident. Her boldness rubbed some people the wrong way, but there was no denying her competitive fire. In an 1896 race, she finished a close second to Tillie Anderson. Dottie fought so hard to win she fainted from exhaustion immediately after clearing the finish line.</p>

          <p>Minnesota was a significant race destination in the 1890s, and Minnesotans were incredibly supportive of the sport. Racing venues in Aurora Park, Athletic Park, and Washington Park could be counted on to overflow with spectators whenever a six-day race came to town. Thousands of fans came out each night to yell themselves hoarse while cheering on their favorite competitor.</p>

          <p>Many of the tour's best racers were from the state. Minneapolitan Mate Christopher, St. Paul's Lillie Harp, Duluth's Nellie Bartlett, and more gave Dottie a run for her money at every race. However, Dottie was arguably the best of the bunch.</p>

          <p>She was one of the state's earliest sports celebrities. The adoration hometown fans showed her sometimes bordered on maniacal. In July 1896, Dottie competed in Minneapolis. On July 6, the final day of racing, fifteen minutes before the start of her last race, she canceled due to illness.</p>

          <p>The crowd of over 2,000 people was beside themselves when they learned Dottie wouldn't compete. Calls to cancel the race went unheeded, and the audience, now acting "as one man," immediately stormed the race track. The restless mob went straight to the ticket office to demand refunds. When event officials refused, a full-scale riot broke out. The angry crowd tore up the track, razed the grandstand, ripped down fences, and destroyed the nearby ticket office.</p>

          <p>Event organizers summoned the police to subdue the crowd, and "heads were cracked." Officers used clubs, and "revolvers were flourished." Many people were injured in the chaos, including three police officers struck by thrown bricks. After a few hours, organizers announced Dottie would race against Tillie Anderson on July 8, and the remaining crowd could attend for free. The fighting soon subsided, and employees distributed tickets to those who remained for the upcoming race.</p>

          <p>The large mob dispersed.</p>

          <p>On April 27, 1899, Dottie married Albert Lester Spencer in Minneapolis. Unlike many contemporaries, she continued competing on the racing tour after marriage. She also publicly maintained her identity and remained "Dottie Farnsworth" in newspaper articles about her or her sport.</p>

          <p>In 1902, Dottie was a touring cyclist with the Walter L. Main Circus. On June 6, she went over the side of the track during a "cycle razzle" exhibition in Salamanca, NY. While at the hospital, doctors determined Dottie was suffering from peritonitis. She died that night from "blood poisoning." After her death, the League of American Wheelmen banned women from competing in six-day races, a ban enforced until 1958. Men's six-day races continued.</p>

          <p>Dottie Farnsworth is buried alongside her husband at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.</p>
